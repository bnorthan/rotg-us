Technical Situation:  Attempts are being made to improve and update our technical skills.  These are ongoing with some challenges.

## Challenge 1 SVBB bank

All our money was in SVBB bank.  Not to be confused with SVB Bank, SVBB bank stands for Silicon Valley Budget Bank, which went bankrupt around the same time (late last week) as SVB Bank.
Unfortunately SVBB bank did not recieve a bail-out and somehow did not even have any FDIC protection on accounts.  Thus we lost some money, though we did not have much.

## Challenge 2 ChatGPT

A new tecnnology that we thought would be very helpful, the AI ChatGPT has been developed.  We thought the AI could do the coding for us and develop us a much better website. 

However our technical team keeps getting distracted and have spent most of their time asking ChatGPT stupid questions, like 'tell me a story about a Bill Clinton going to the Rodeo with Ron Paul". 

Thus ChatGPT has overall lowered our productivity due to the amount of time our team spends asking stupid questions.

## Team age and knowledge

We would like to address this as we don't think this is a huge problem.  Our team is older and expensive (salaries increase as ones career moves on).  

We've been told we'd save a lot of money if we fired them all and hired a younger team with an average age of 20.5 who are quite skilled at getting chatgpt to make their homework websites.

We absolutely will not be firing our team and hiring a younger team.  Loyalty is important to us.
